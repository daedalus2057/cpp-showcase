Selected projects over the course of my journey working with the mighty C++

## What is here

I have been working with C++ during my pursuit of a masters in computer science since 2019. There have been many projects large and small from algorithm work to custom data structures and cli applictions.

I plan on posting a selection of projects here for interested parties to get a glimpse of the work I have been doing. This is by no means exhaustive but I feel it represents pretty well where I am in my journey with C++.

## Selected Projects

### Deter

This is a matrix determinent calculation project. It is pretty early in my C++ career but has some math oriented work.

### RTree

RTree is a computer science master therom helper. It takes in a recursive definition T(n) and produces the first few levels of the resulting recursive tree this produces showing the growth rate.
This project is a good mix of parsing logic and computation work. In the Algorithms class this was for, I was one of the few students who derived the right algo for the project.

### Scorp

Scorp = Scorpion Solitare. This is a game simulater, the mechanics are fleshed out and this project makes use of some basic RAII and Rule of Zero practices. There is also smart pointer usage and some basic object oriented structure to this project.

## What's next

My next projects are slotted to be based around embedded and async programming. Stay tuned!
